	    <hr>
	    <p>Originally from Tucson Arizona, I moved 4 hours north to beautiful Flagstaff to study at NAU. <br>Its cold winters allowed me to pursue the exciting snowboarding culture. <br>From hiking to snowy untouched peaks to building ramps in the city, my friends and I did it all. </p>

	    <p>I spend the Summers doing lots of hiking, backpacking, and camping. <br>My love for the outdoors pairs perfectly with what Flagstaff and its surroundings have to offer. <br>My other hobbies include cliff jumping, kayaking, pickleball, and disc golf.</p>

		<p>As you may have seen from my <a href="education.html">transcript</a>, I did a 4.5 year college plan so that I could get the full CompSci educational experience, while also enjoying a fun, adventurous lifestyle. As my class workload lessens, I have shifted my focus to obtaining knowledge that will set me apart from the majority of computer science new grads. A large fraction of my personal time includes extensive research into Python, OOP languages such as Java and C++, machine learning, and scripting languages. I am in search for a company eager to utilize my tenacious work ethic, creative problem-solving skills, and affable personality.</p>
